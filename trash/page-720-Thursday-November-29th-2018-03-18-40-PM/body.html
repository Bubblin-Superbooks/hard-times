<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; What I shall say to people in general, of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law, will be this.&nbsp; I am Josiah Bounderby, and I had my bringing-up; she&rsquo;s the daughter of Tom Gradgrind, and she had her bringing-up; and the two horses wouldn&rsquo;t pull together.&nbsp; I am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man, I believe; and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a woman rather out of the common, also, who, in the long run, would come up to my mark.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this, Bounderby,&rsquo; urged Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;before you commit yourself to such a decision.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
