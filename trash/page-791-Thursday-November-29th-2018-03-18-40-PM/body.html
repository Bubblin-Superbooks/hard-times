<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; It was five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of the bright autumnal Sunday, before a candle was sent down to try the air, while three or four rough faces stood crowded close together, attentively watching it: the man at the windlass lowering as they were told.&nbsp; The candle was brought up again, feebly burning, and then some water was cast in.&nbsp; Then the bucket was hooked on; and the sobered man and another got in with lights, giving the word &lsquo;Lower away!&rsquo;</p><p>As the rope went out, tight and strained, and the windlass creaked, there was not a breath among the one or two hundred men and women looking on, that came as it was wont to come.&nbsp; The signal was given and the windlass stopped, with abundant rope to spare.</p></div> </div>
