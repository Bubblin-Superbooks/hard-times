<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I really ought to apologise to you&mdash;being only Josiah Bounderby of Coketown&mdash;for having stood in your light so long.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t name it, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit.&nbsp; &lsquo;If that portrait could speak, sir&mdash;but it has the advantage over the original of not possessing the power of committing itself and disgusting others,&mdash;it would testify, that a long period has elapsed since I first habitually addressed it as the picture of a Noodle.&nbsp; Nothing that a Noodle does, can awaken surprise or indignation; the proceedings of a Noodle can only inspire contempt.&rsquo;</p><p>Thus saying, Mrs. Sparsit, with her Roman features like a medal struck to commemorate her scorn of Mr. Bounderby, surveyed him fixedly from head to foot, swept disdainfully past him, and ascended the staircase.</p></div> </div>
