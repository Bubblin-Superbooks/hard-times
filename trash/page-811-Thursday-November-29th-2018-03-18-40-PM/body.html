<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mr. Gradgrind went home, locked himself in his room, and kept it all that day.&nbsp; When Sissy and Louisa tapped at his door, he said, without opening it, &lsquo;Not now, my dears; in the evening.&rsquo;&nbsp; On their return in the evening, he said, &lsquo;I am not able yet&mdash;to-morrow.&rsquo;&nbsp; He ate nothing all day, and had no candle after dark; and they heard him walking to and fro late at night.</p><p>But, in the morning he appeared at breakfast at the usual hour, and took his usual place at the table.&nbsp; Aged and bent he looked, and quite bowed down; and yet he looked a wiser man, and a better man, than in the days when in this life he wanted nothing&mdash;but Facts.&nbsp; Before he left the room, he appointed a time for them to come to him; and so, with his gray head drooping, went away.</p></div> </div>
