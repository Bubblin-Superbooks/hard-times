<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Went to Westminster School as a King&rsquo;s Scholar, when I was principally living on garbage, and sleeping in market baskets.&nbsp; Why, if I wanted to keep a dozen horses&mdash;which I don&rsquo;t, for one&rsquo;s enough for me&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t bear to see &rsquo;em in their stalls here, and think what my own lodging used to be.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t look at &rsquo;em, sir, and not order &rsquo;em out.&nbsp; Yet so things come round.&nbsp; You see this place; you know what sort of a place it is; you are aware that there&rsquo;s not a completer place of its size in this kingdom or elsewhere&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care where&mdash;and here, got into the middle of it, like a maggot into a nut, is Josiah Bounderby.</p></div> </div>
