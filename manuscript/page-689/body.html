<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;So startling an announcement, so confidently made, and by such lips, is really disconcerting in the last degree.&nbsp; May I be permitted to inquire, if you are charged to convey that information to me in those hopeless words, by the lady of whom we speak?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I have no charge from her.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;The drowning man catches at the straw.&nbsp; With no disrespect for your judgment, and with no doubt of your sincerity, excuse my saying that I cling to the belief that there is yet hope that I am not condemned to perpetual exile from that lady&rsquo;s presence.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;There is not the least hope.&nbsp; The first object of my coming here, sir, is to assure you that you must believe that there is no more hope of your ever speaking with her again, than there would be if she had died when she came home last night.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
