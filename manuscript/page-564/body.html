<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In the drawing-room after dinner, Mr. Bounderby tried the case of the robbery, examined the witnesses, made notes of the evidence, found the suspected persons guilty, and sentenced them to the extreme punishment of the law.&nbsp; That done, Bitzer was dismissed to town with instructions to recommend Tom to come home by the mail-train.</p><p>When candles were brought, Mrs. Sparsit murmured, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be low, sir.&nbsp; Pray let me see you cheerful, sir, as I used to do.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby, upon whom these consolations had begun to produce the effect of making him, in a bull-headed blundering way, sentimental, sighed like some large sea-animal.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot bear to see you so, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit.&nbsp; &lsquo;Try a hand at backgammon, sir, as you used to do when I had the honour of living under your roof.</p></div> </div>
