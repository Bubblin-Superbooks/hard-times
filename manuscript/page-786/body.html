<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Sunday was a bright Sunday in autumn, clear and cool, when early in the morning Sissy and Rachael met, to walk in the country.</p><p>As Coketown cast ashes not only on its own head but on the neighbourhood&rsquo;s too&mdash;after the manner of those pious persons who do penance for their own sins by putting other people into sackcloth&mdash;it was customary for those who now and then thirsted for a draught of pure air, which is not absolutely the most wicked among the vanities of life, to get a few miles away by the railroad, and then begin their walk, or their lounge in the fields.&nbsp; Sissy and Rachael helped themselves out of the smoke by the usual means, and were put down at a station about midway between the town and Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s retreat.</p></div> </div>
