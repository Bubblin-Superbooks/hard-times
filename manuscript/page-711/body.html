<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; whispered Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;my nerves are at present too much shaken, and my health is at present too much impaired, in your service, to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Which she did.)</p><p>&lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Bounderby, &lsquo;without making any observation to you that may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family, what I have got to add to that, is that there is something else in which it appears to me you may take refuge, namely, a coach.&nbsp; And the coach in which we came here being at the door, you&rsquo;ll allow me to hand you down to it, and pack you home to the Bank: where the best course for you to pursue, will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear, and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed.</p></div> </div>
