<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>You saw nothing in Coketown but what was severely workful.&nbsp; If the members of a religious persuasion built a chapel there&mdash;as the members of eighteen religious persuasions had done&mdash;they made it a pious warehouse of red brick, with sometimes (but this is only in highly ornamental examples) a bell in a birdcage on the top of it.&nbsp; The solitary exception was the New Church; a stuccoed edifice with a square steeple over the door, terminating in four short pinnacles like florid wooden legs.&nbsp; All the public inscriptions in the town were painted alike, in severe characters of black and white.&nbsp; The jail might have been the infirmary, the infirmary might have been the jail, the town-hall might have been either, or both, or anything else, for anything that appeared to the contrary in the graces of their construction.</p></div> </div>
