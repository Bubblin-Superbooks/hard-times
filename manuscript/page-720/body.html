<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I know the bricks of this town, and I know the works of this town, and I know the chimneys of this town, and I know the smoke of this town, and I know the Hands of this town.&nbsp; I know &rsquo;em all pretty well.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re real.&nbsp; When a man tells me anything about imaginative qualities, I always tell that man, whoever he is, that I know what he means.&nbsp; He means turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon, and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what your daughter wants.&nbsp; Since you are of opinion that she ought to have what she wants, I recommend you to provide it for her.&nbsp; Because, Tom Gradgrind, she will never have it from me.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
