<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mr. Sleary had only made one cut at the Clown with his long whip-lash, and the Clown had only said, &lsquo;If you do it again, I&rsquo;ll throw the horse at you!&rsquo; when Sissy was recognised both by father and daughter.&nbsp; But they got through the Act with great self-possession; and Mr. Sleary, saving for the first instant, conveyed no more expression into his locomotive eye than into his fixed one.&nbsp; The performance seemed a little long to Sissy and Louisa, particularly when it stopped to afford the Clown an opportunity of telling Mr. Sleary (who said &lsquo;Indeed, sir!&rsquo; to all his observations in the calmest way, and with his eye on the house) about two legs sitting on three legs looking at one leg, when in came four legs, and laid hold of one leg, and up got two legs, caught hold of three legs, and threw &rsquo;em at four legs, who ran away with one leg.</p></div> </div>
