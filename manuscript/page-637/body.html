<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Lo, Louisa coming out of the house!&nbsp; Hastily cloaked and muffled, and stealing away.&nbsp; She elopes!&nbsp; She falls from the lowermost stair, and is swallowed up in the gulf.</p><p>Indifferent to the rain, and moving with a quick determined step, she struck into a side-path parallel with the ride.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit followed in the shadow of the trees, at but a short distance; for it was not easy to keep a figure in view going quickly through the umbrageous darkness.</p><p>When she stopped to close the side-gate without noise, Mrs. Sparsit stopped.&nbsp; When she went on, Mrs. Sparsit went on.&nbsp; She went by the way Mrs. Sparsit had come, emerged from the green lane, crossed the stony road, and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad.&nbsp; A train for Coketown would come through presently, Mrs. Sparsit knew; so she understood Coketown to be her first place of destination.</p></div> </div>
