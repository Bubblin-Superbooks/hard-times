<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;I think differently,&rsquo; blustered Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am going to finish this business according to my own opinions.&nbsp; Now, I don&rsquo;t want to make a quarrel of it with you, Tom Gradgrind.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I don&rsquo;t think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject.&nbsp; As to your gentleman-friend, he may take himself off, wherever he likes best.&nbsp; If he falls in my way, I shall tell him my mind; if he don&rsquo;t fall in my way, I shan&rsquo;t, for it won&rsquo;t be worth my while to do it.&nbsp; As to your daughter, whom I made Loo Bounderby, and might have done better by leaving Loo Gradgrind, if she don&rsquo;t come home to-morrow, by twelve o&rsquo;clock at noon, I shall understand that she prefers to stay away, and I shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here, and you&rsquo;ll take charge of her for the future.</p></div> </div>
