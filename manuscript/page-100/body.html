<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no family pride about me, there&rsquo;s no imaginative sentimental humbug about me.&nbsp; I call a spade a spade; and I call the mother of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, without any fear or any favour, what I should call her if she had been the mother of Dick Jones of Wapping.&nbsp; So, with this man.&nbsp; He is a runaway rogue and a vagabond, that&rsquo;s what he is, in English.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all the same to me what he is or what he is not, whether in English or whether in French,&rsquo; retorted Mr. E. W. B. Childers, facing about.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am telling your friend what&rsquo;s the fact; if you don&rsquo;t like to hear it, you can avail yourself of the open air.&nbsp; You give it mouth enough, you do; but give it mouth in your own building at least,&rsquo; remonstrated E. W. B. with stern irony.</p></div> </div>
