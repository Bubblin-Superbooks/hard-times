<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sissy Jupe had not an easy time of it, between Mr. M&rsquo;Choakumchild and Mrs. Gradgrind, and was not without strong impulses, in the first months of her probation, to run away.&nbsp; It hailed facts all day long so very hard, and life in general was opened to her as such a closely ruled ciphering-book, that assuredly she would have run away, but for only one restraint.</p><p>It is lamentable to think of; but this restraint was the result of no arithmetical process, was self-imposed in defiance of all calculation, and went dead against any table of probabilities that any Actuary would have drawn up from the premises.&nbsp; The girl believed that her father had not deserted her; she lived in the hope that he would come back, and in the faith that he would be made the happier by her remaining where she was.</p></div> </div>
