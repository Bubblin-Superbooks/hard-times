<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A rather stooping man, with a knitted brow, a pondering expression of face, and a hard-looking head sufficiently capacious, on which his iron-grey hair lay long and thin, Old Stephen might have passed for a particularly intelligent man in his condition.&nbsp; Yet he was not.&nbsp; He took no place among those remarkable &lsquo;Hands,&rsquo; who, piecing together their broken intervals of leisure through many years, had mastered difficult sciences, and acquired a knowledge of most unlikely things.&nbsp; He held no station among the Hands who could make speeches and carry on debates.&nbsp; Thousands of his compeers could talk much better than he, at any time.&nbsp; He was a good power-loom weaver, and a man of perfect integrity.&nbsp; What more he was, or what else he had in him, if anything, let him show for himself.</p></div> </div>
