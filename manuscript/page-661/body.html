<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;My unfortunate child.&rsquo;&nbsp; The place was so difficult to get over, that he tried again.</p><p>&lsquo;It would be hopeless for me, Louisa, to endeavour to tell you how overwhelmed I have been, and still am, by what broke upon me last night.&nbsp; The ground on which I stand has ceased to be solid under my feet.&nbsp; The only support on which I leaned, and the strength of which it seemed, and still does seem, impossible to question, has given way in an instant.&nbsp; I am stunned by these discoveries.&nbsp; I have no selfish meaning in what I say; but I find the shock of what broke upon me last night, to be very heavy indeed.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
