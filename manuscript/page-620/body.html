<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>An overcast September evening, just at nightfall, saw beneath its drooping eyelids Mrs. Sparsit glide out of her carriage, pass down the wooden steps of the little station into a stony road, cross it into a green lane, and become hidden in a summer-growth of leaves and branches.&nbsp; One or two late birds sleepily chirping in their nests, and a bat heavily crossing and recrossing her, and the reek of her own tread in the thick dust that felt like velvet, were all Mrs. Sparsit heard or saw until she very softly closed a gate.</p><p>She went up to the house, keeping within the shrubbery, and went round it, peeping between the leaves at the lower windows.&nbsp; Most of them were open, as they usually were in such warm weather, but there were no lights yet, and all was silent.&nbsp; She tried the garden with no better effect.</p></div> </div>
