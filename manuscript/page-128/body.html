<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The late Mr. Sparsit, being by the mother&rsquo;s side a Powler, married this lady, being by the father&rsquo;s side a Scadgers.&nbsp; Lady Scadgers (an immensely fat old woman, with an inordinate appetite for butcher&rsquo;s meat, and a mysterious leg which had now refused to get out of bed for fourteen years) contrived the marriage, at a period when Sparsit was just of age, and chiefly noticeable for a slender body, weakly supported on two long slim props, and surmounted by no head worth mentioning.&nbsp; He inherited a fair fortune from his uncle, but owed it all before he came into it, and spent it twice over immediately afterwards.&nbsp; Thus, when he died, at twenty-four (the scene of his decease, Calais, and the cause, brandy), he did not leave his widow, from whom he had been separated soon after the honeymoon, in affluent circumstances.</p></div> </div>
