<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby closed the door, and stood before the fire; projecting himself after his old explosive manner into his portrait&mdash;and into futurity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Into how much of futurity?&nbsp; He saw Mrs. Sparsit fighting out a daily fight at the points of all the weapons in the female armoury, with the grudging, smarting, peevish, tormenting Lady Scadgers, still laid up in bed with her mysterious leg, and gobbling her insufficient income down by about the middle of every quarter, in a mean little airless lodging, a mere closet for one, a mere crib for two; but did he see more?&nbsp; Did he catch any glimpse of himself making a show of Bitzer to strangers, as the rising young man, so devoted to his master&rsquo;s great merits, who had won young Tom&rsquo;s place, and had almost captured young Tom himself, in the times when by various rascals he was spirited away?&nbsp;</p></div> </div>
