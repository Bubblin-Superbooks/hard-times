<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A very regular feature on the face of the country, Stone Lodge was.&nbsp; Not the least disguise toned down or shaded off that uncompromising fact in the landscape.&nbsp; A great square house, with a heavy portico darkening the principal windows, as its master&rsquo;s heavy brows overshadowed his eyes.&nbsp; A calculated, cast up, balanced, and proved house.&nbsp; Six windows on this side of the door, six on that side; a total of twelve in this wing, a total of twelve in the other wing; four-and-twenty carried over to the back wings.&nbsp; A lawn and garden and an infant avenue, all ruled straight like a botanical account-book.&nbsp; Gas and ventilation, drainage and water-service, all of the primest quality.&nbsp; Iron clamps and girders, fire-proof from top to bottom; mechanical lifts for the housemaids, with all their brushes and brooms; everything that heart could desire.</p></div> </div>
