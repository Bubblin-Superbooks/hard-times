<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thomas Gradgrind, sir.&nbsp; A man of realities.&nbsp; A man of facts and calculations.&nbsp; A man who proceeds upon the principle that two and two are four, and nothing over, and who is not to be talked into allowing for anything over.&nbsp; Thomas Gradgrind, sir&mdash;peremptorily Thomas&mdash;Thomas Gradgrind.&nbsp; With a rule and a pair of scales, and the multiplication table always in his pocket, sir, ready to weigh and measure any parcel of human nature, and tell you exactly what it comes to.&nbsp; It is a mere question of figures, a case of simple arithmetic.&nbsp; You might hope to get some other nonsensical belief into the head of George Gradgrind, or Augustus Gradgrind, or John Gradgrind, or Joseph Gradgrind (all supposititious, non-existent persons), but into the head of Thomas Gradgrind&mdash;no, sir!</p></div> </div>
