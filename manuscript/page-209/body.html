<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Fairy palaces burst into illumination, before pale morning showed the monstrous serpents of smoke trailing themselves over Coketown.&nbsp; A clattering of clogs upon the pavement; a rapid ringing of bells; and all the melancholy mad elephants, polished and oiled up for the day&rsquo;s monotony, were at their heavy exercise again.</p><p>Stephen bent over his loom, quiet, watchful, and steady.&nbsp; A special contrast, as every man was in the forest of looms where Stephen worked, to the crashing, smashing, tearing piece of mechanism at which he laboured.&nbsp; Never fear, good people of an anxious turn of mind, that Art will consign Nature to oblivion.&nbsp; Set anywhere, side by side, the work of God and the work of man; and the former, even though it be a troop of Hands of very small account, will gain in dignity from the comparison.</p></div> </div>
