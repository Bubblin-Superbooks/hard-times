<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;Jupe, I have made up my mind to take you into my house; and, when you are not in attendance at the school, to employ you about Mrs. Gradgrind, who is rather an invalid.&nbsp; I have explained to Miss Louisa&mdash;this is Miss Louisa&mdash;the miserable but natural end of your late career; and you are to expressly understand that the whole of that subject is past, and is not to be referred to any more.&nbsp; From this time you begin your history.&nbsp; You are, at present, ignorant, I know.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I shall have the satisfaction of causing you to be strictly educated; and you will be a living proof to all who come into communication with you, of the advantages of the training you will receive.&nbsp; You will be reclaimed and formed.</p></div> </div>
