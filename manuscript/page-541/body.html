<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When the Devil goeth about like a roaring lion, he goeth about in a shape by which few but savages and hunters are attracted.&nbsp; But, when he is trimmed, smoothed, and varnished, according to the mode; when he is aweary of vice, and aweary of virtue, used up as to brimstone, and used up as to bliss; then, whether he take to the serving out of red tape, or to the kindling of red fire, he is the very Devil.</p><p>So James Harthouse reclined in the window, indolently smoking, and reckoning up the steps he had taken on the road by which he happened to be travelling.&nbsp; The end to which it led was before him, pretty plainly; but he troubled himself with no calculations about it.&nbsp; What will be, will be.</p></div> </div>
