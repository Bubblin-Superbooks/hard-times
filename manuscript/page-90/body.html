<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Before Mr. Bounderby could reply, a young man appeared at the door, and introducing himself with the words, &lsquo;By your leaves, gentlemen!&rsquo; walked in with his hands in his pockets.&nbsp; His face, close-shaven, thin, and sallow, was shaded by a great quantity of dark hair, brushed into a roll all round his head, and parted up the centre.&nbsp; His legs were very robust, but shorter than legs of good proportions should have been.&nbsp; His chest and back were as much too broad, as his legs were too short.&nbsp; He was dressed in a Newmarket coat and tight-fitting trousers; wore a shawl round his neck; smelt of lamp-oil, straw, orange-peel, horses&rsquo; provender, and sawdust; and looked a most remarkable sort of Centaur, compounded of the stable and the play-house.&nbsp; Where the one began, and the other ended, nobody could have told with any precision.</p></div> </div>
