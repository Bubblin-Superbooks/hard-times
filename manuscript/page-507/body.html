<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;Have you an interest in anything, Mr. Harthouse?&rsquo; she asked, half incredulously and half gratefully.</p><p>&lsquo;If you had asked me when I first came here, I should have said no.&nbsp; I must say now&mdash;even at the hazard of appearing to make a pretence, and of justly awakening your incredulity&mdash;yes.&rsquo;</p><p>She made a slight movement, as if she were trying to speak, but could not find voice; at length she said, &lsquo;Mr. Harthouse, I give you credit for being interested in my brother.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Thank you.&nbsp; I claim to deserve it.&nbsp; You know how little I do claim, but I will go that length.&nbsp; You have done so much for him, you are so fond of him; your whole life, Mrs. Bounderby, expresses such charming self-forgetfulness on his account&mdash;pardon me again&mdash;I am running wide of the subject.&nbsp; I am interested in him for his own sake.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
