<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Night and day, Mrs. Sparsit kept it standing.&nbsp; When Louisa had arrived at the bottom and disappeared in the gulf, it might fall in upon her if it would; but, until then, there it was to be, a Building, before Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; And there Louisa always was, upon it.</p><p>And always gliding down, down, down!</p><p>Mrs. Sparsit saw James Harthouse come and go; she heard of him here and there; she saw the changes of the face he had studied; she, too, remarked to a nicety how and when it clouded, how and when it cleared; she kept her black eyes wide open, with no touch of pity, with no touch of compunction, all absorbed in interest.&nbsp; In the interest of seeing her, ever drawing, with no hand to stay her, nearer and nearer to the bottom of this new Giant&rsquo;s Staircase.</p></div> </div>
