<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;But, my dear Tom, if your sister has not got it&mdash;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Not got it, Mr. Harthouse?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say she has got it.&nbsp; I may have wanted more than she was likely to have got.&nbsp; But then she ought to get it.&nbsp; She could get it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s of no use pretending to make a secret of matters now, after what I have told you already; you know she didn&rsquo;t marry old Bounderby for her own sake, or for his sake, but for my sake.&nbsp; Then why doesn&rsquo;t she get what I want, out of him, for my sake?&nbsp; She is not obliged to say what she is going to do with it; she is sharp enough; she could manage to coax it out of him, if she chose.&nbsp; Then why doesn&rsquo;t she choose, when I tell her of what consequence it is?&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; There she sits in his company like a stone, instead of making herself agreeable and getting it easily.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what you may call this, but I call it unnatural conduct.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
