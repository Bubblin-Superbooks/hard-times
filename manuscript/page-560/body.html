<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Long after Louisa had undressed and lain down, she watched and waited for her brother&rsquo;s coming home.&nbsp; That could hardly be, she knew, until an hour past midnight; but in the country silence, which did anything but calm the trouble of her thoughts, time lagged wearily.&nbsp; At last, when the darkness and stillness had seemed for hours to thicken one another, she heard the bell at the gate.&nbsp; She felt as though she would have been glad that it rang on until daylight; but it ceased, and the circles of its last sound spread out fainter and wider in the air, and all was dead again.</p><p>She waited yet some quarter of an hour, as she judged.&nbsp; Then she arose, put on a loose robe, and went out of her room in the dark, and up the staircase to her brother&rsquo;s room.</p></div> </div>
