<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I entertain a weak idea that the English people are as hard-worked as any people upon whom the sun shines.&nbsp; I acknowledge to this ridiculous idiosyncrasy, as a reason why I would give them a little more play.</p><p>In the hardest working part of Coketown; in the innermost fortifications of that ugly citadel, where Nature was as strongly bricked out as killing airs and gases were bricked in; at the heart of the labyrinth of narrow courts upon courts, and close streets upon streets, which had come into existence piecemeal, every piece in a violent hurry for some one man&rsquo;s purpose, and the whole an unnatural family, shouldering, and trampling, and pressing one another to death; in the last close nook of this great exhausted receiver, where the chimneys, for want of air to make a draught, were built in an immense variety of stunted and crooked shapes, as though every house put out a sign of the kind of people who might be expected to be born in it;</p></div> </div>
