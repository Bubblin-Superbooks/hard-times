<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Good!&nbsp; Hear, hear!&nbsp; Hurrah!&nbsp; The eagerness both of attention and intention, exhibited in all the countenances, made them a most impressive sight.&nbsp; There was no carelessness, no languor, no idle curiosity; none of the many shades of indifference to be seen in all other assemblies, visible for one moment there.&nbsp; That every man felt his condition to be, somehow or other, worse than it might be; that every man considered it incumbent on him to join the rest, towards the making of it better; that every man felt his only hope to be in his allying himself to the comrades by whom he was surrounded; and that in this belief, right or wrong (unhappily wrong then), the whole of that crowd were gravely, deeply, faithfully in earnest; must have been as plain to any one who chose to see what was there, as the bare beams of the roof and the whitened brick walls.</p></div> </div>
