<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; In the drawing-room of which mansion, there presently entered to them the most remarkable girl Mr. James Harthouse had ever seen.&nbsp; She was so constrained, and yet so careless; so reserved, and yet so watchful; so cold and proud, and yet so sensitively ashamed of her husband&rsquo;s braggart humility&mdash;from which she shrunk as if every example of it were a cut or a blow; that it was quite a new sensation to observe her.&nbsp; In face she was no less remarkable than in manner.&nbsp; Her features were handsome; but their natural play was so locked up, that it seemed impossible to guess at their genuine expression.&nbsp; Utterly indifferent, perfectly self-reliant, never at a loss, and yet never at her ease, with her figure in company with them there, and her mind apparently quite alone&mdash;it was of no use &lsquo;going in&rsquo; yet awhile to comprehend this girl, for she baffled all penetration.</p></div> </div>
