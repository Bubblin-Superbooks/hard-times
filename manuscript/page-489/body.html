<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was the lady who had once kept Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s house, sitting at the first-floor window as he had seen her before; and there was the light porter, sometimes talking with her there, and sometimes looking over the blind below which had Bank upon it, and sometimes coming to the door and standing on the steps for a breath of air.&nbsp; When he first came out, Stephen thought he might be looking for him, and passed near; but the light porter only cast his winking eyes upon him slightly, and said nothing.</p><p>Two hours were a long stretch of lounging about, after a long day&rsquo;s labour.&nbsp; Stephen sat upon the step of a door, leaned against a wall under an archway, strolled up and down, listened for the church clock, stopped and watched children playing in the street.</p></div> </div>
