<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;I have written to Stephen by the post that went out this afternoon, as I have written to him once before sin&rsquo; he went away,&rsquo; said Rachael; &lsquo;and he will be here, at furthest, in two days.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll tell you something.&nbsp; You are not aware perhaps,&rsquo; retorted Mr. Bounderby, &lsquo;that you yourself have been looked after now and then, not being considered quite free from suspicion in this business, on account of most people being judged according to the company they keep.&nbsp; The post-office hasn&rsquo;t been forgotten either.&nbsp; What I&rsquo;ll tell you is, that no letter to Stephen Blackpool has ever got into it.&nbsp; Therefore, what has become of yours, I leave you to guess.&nbsp; Perhaps you&rsquo;re mistaken, and never wrote any.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
