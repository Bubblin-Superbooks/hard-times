<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A sunny midsummer day.&nbsp; There was such a thing sometimes, even in Coketown.</p><p>Seen from a distance in such weather, Coketown lay shrouded in a haze of its own, which appeared impervious to the sun&rsquo;s rays.&nbsp; You only knew the town was there, because you knew there could have been no such sulky blotch upon the prospect without a town.&nbsp; A blur of soot and smoke, now confusedly tending this way, now that way, now aspiring to the vault of Heaven, now murkily creeping along the earth, as the wind rose and fell, or changed its quarter: a dense formless jumble, with sheets of cross light in it, that showed nothing but masses of darkness:&mdash;Coketown in the distance was suggestive of itself, though not a brick of it could be seen.</p></div> </div>
