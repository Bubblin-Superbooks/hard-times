<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; However, if I feel a little independent when I look around this table to-day, and reflect how little I thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind&rsquo;s daughter when I was a ragged street-boy, who never washed his face unless it was at a pump, and that not oftener than once a fortnight, I hope I may be excused.&nbsp; So, I hope you like my feeling independent; if you don&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; I do feel independent.&nbsp; Now I have mentioned, and you have mentioned, that I am this day married to Tom Gradgrind&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; I am very glad to be so.&nbsp; It has long been my wish to be so.&nbsp; I have watched her bringing-up, and I believe she is worthy of me.&nbsp; At the same time&mdash;not to deceive you&mdash;I believe I am worthy of her.</p></div> </div>
