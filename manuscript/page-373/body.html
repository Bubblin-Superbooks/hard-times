<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and Mr. James Harthouse&rsquo;s card, Mr. Bounderby put on his hat and went down to the Hotel.&nbsp; There he found Mr. James Harthouse looking out of window, in a state of mind so disconsolate, that he was already half-disposed to &lsquo;go in&rsquo; for something else.</p><p>&lsquo;My name, sir,&rsquo; said his visitor, &lsquo;is Josiah Bounderby, of Coketown.&rsquo;</p><p>Mr. James Harthouse was very happy indeed (though he scarcely looked so) to have a pleasure he had long expected.</p><p>&lsquo;Coketown, sir,&rsquo; said Bounderby, obstinately taking a chair, &lsquo;is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to.&nbsp; Therefore, if you will allow me&mdash;or whether you will or not, for I am a plain man&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you something about it before we go any further.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
