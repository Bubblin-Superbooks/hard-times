<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;Because, Tom,&rsquo; said his sister, after silently watching the sparks awhile, &lsquo;as I get older, and nearer growing up, I often sit wondering here, and think how unfortunate it is for me that I can&rsquo;t reconcile you to home better than I am able to do.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what other girls know.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t play to you, or sing to you.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t talk to you so as to lighten your mind, for I never see any amusing sights or read any amusing books that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about, when you are tired.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Well, no more do I.&nbsp; I am as bad as you in that respect; and I am a Mule too, which you&rsquo;re not.</p></div> </div>
